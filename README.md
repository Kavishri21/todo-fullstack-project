# todo-fullstack-project 🚀

**Full-Stack Todo App** — A web application with a React (or JS/HTML/CSS) frontend and a Spring Boot backend, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete tasks (a classic Todo list).

---

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates a full-stack web application combining a modern front-end and a robust backend:

- **Frontend**: A responsive, interactive user interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React — modify as per your front-end tech).  
- **Backend**: A RESTful API server built with Spring Boot and Java, exposing endpoints to manage tasks (CRUD operations), and using MySQL (or any relational DB) for persistence.  
- **Purpose**: Serves both as a learning project for full-stack development and as a portfolio piece to showcase practical understanding of front-end / back-end integration, RESTful APIs, and full project lifecycle (dev → commit → deploy).  

This is especially useful for anyone looking to learn or interview for full-stack developer roles, or wanting to explore how front- and back-end communicate in a simple but realistic web app.
